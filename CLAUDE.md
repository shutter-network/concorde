# Shared Agent Framework

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as local markdown under `.scratch/<feature>/` — no remote
tracker, no external contributors. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Two statuses only, written as a `Status:` line at creation: `ready-for-agent` and
`needs-human`. No untriaged state; rejected issues are deleted, done issues move
to `.scratch/<feature>/done/`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at the root plus `docs/adr/`. See
`docs/agents/domain.md`.
